Web-controlled ON AIR sign
=======

Build your own web-controlled colorful and animated ON AIR sign! The code runs on [micropython](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/esp8266/tutorial/intro.html). You will need a simple level-shifter circuit to convert the ESP8266's 3.3v logic to 5v to drive the neopixels (see the circuit sketch in circuit.jpg).

Parts list:
* ESP8266 module (we used [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N8UUE3L))
* Neopixel LED strip (you'll need about half a meter; we used [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HXFKMYS))
* 2.2 K Ohm resistor
* 6.8 K Ohm resistor
* big electrolytic capacitor (e.g., 10v 220 micro Farad)
* 3D printed case (see 3d_model)
* parchment paper for a diffuser
* soldering iron, solder, hookup wire, hot glue
